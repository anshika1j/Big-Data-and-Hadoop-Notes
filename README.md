# Welcome to my GitHub repository for Big Data and Hadoop notes!
### Data is the new oil, but like oil, it needs to be refined before it's valuable.
Letâ€™s learn how to refine and handle massive data with Big Data & Hadoop.

## What is Big Data?
Big Data refers to extremely large, complex, and fast-growing datasets that cannot be handled by traditional data tools like Excel or SQL alone.

### Characteristics of Big Data (5 V's):
| V            | Meaning                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Volume**   | Massive amount of data (terabytes to petabytes)                     |
| **Velocity** | Speed at which data is generated and processed (real-time, streams) |
| **Variety**  | Different formats: text, images, videos, logs, etc.                 |
| **Veracity** | Data may be messy, incomplete, or uncertain                         |
| **Value**    | Extracting useful insights from raw data                            |

### Why is Big Data Important?
1. Businesses want to understand customer behavior
2. Governments need to track trends (weather, pandemics)
3. Companies want real-time decision making (Netflix, Amazon)
4. Healthcare needs predictive diagnosis based on past data

## What is Hadoop?
Hadoop is an open-source framework used to store and process Big Data in a distributed and scalable way using simple hardware.

### Hadoop Components:
| Component                  | Role                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HDFS (Storage)**         | Hadoop Distributed File System stores large data across clusters |
| **MapReduce (Processing)** | Programming model for processing large datasets in parallel      |
| **YARN**                   | Manages resources and job scheduling                             |
| **Hadoop Common**          | Utilities and libraries for all modules                          |

### Why Learn Hadoop?
1. Handle Terabytes+ of Data easily across low-cost machines
2. Learn how distributed computing works
3. Foundation for data engineering, analytics, and machine learning
4. Widely used in enterprises, banking, retail, healthcare, telecom

## Real-World Use Cases:
| Industry      | How Big Data + Hadoop Helps                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Netflix    | Analyzes user behavior for movie recommendations                     |
|  Amazon     | Tracks every click to optimize pricing, ads, delivery, etc.          |
|  Uber       | Processes GPS + traffic data to match riders and drivers efficiently |
|  Banking    | Fraud detection and risk modeling using massive transaction data     |
|  Healthcare | Predictive analysis based on medical records and patient behavior    |
|  Weather    | Real-time satellite + sensor data processing for accurate forecasts  |
